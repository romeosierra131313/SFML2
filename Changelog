v0.01 --
-setup and test environment
-got tileset loading 
-basic grid ,tile texture selection and drawing 



v0.02 --May 19th 2019

added cursor and controls (Up,Down etc and Z for selection)
Changed default tile texture 
added adaptable entities  (TODO make entity subclass for tile vs pawn )
converted tile to entity so all tile can be animated 
broke the panel selector (temporarily using "y,u,i,o,p")for selection until a more succinct solution found
